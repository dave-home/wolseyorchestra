<h1>Wolsey Orchestra: Privacy Policy</h1>

<hr>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
The purpose of this document is to set out how the Wolsey Orchestra collects, stores, processes and protects your personal data that is held by us. The Wolsey Orchestra is committed to protecting your privacy and to safeguarding your personal data is important to us. This policy applies to all members of the Wolsey Orchestra. The Wolsey Orchestra committee may choose to update this policy from time to time. 
</p>

<p>
This document was written in accordance to the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) which came into force on 25 May 2018.
</p>

The latest version of this document can be found at <a href="http://www.wolseyorchestra.org/privacy.html">http://www.wolseyorchestra.org/privacy.html</a>.
</p>

<h2>2. Why do we need your personal data?</h2>

<p>
When you become a playing member of the Wolsey Orchestra, we need to collect a certain amount of personal data about you in order to facilitate the day-to-day running of the orchestra i.e. in order that we can contact you about playing in forthcoming concerts, to let you know the pertinent details of rehearsals and concerts (when and where they are taking place, what pieces are being rehearsed at which time, etc), to let you know about changes to those details (e.g. if a rehearsal is cancelled due to weather conditions), etc.
</p>

<h2>3. What personal data do we collect?</h2>

<p>
We will collect and store the following personal details from all our members:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Name
<li>E-mail Address(es)
<li>Telephone number(s)
</ul>

<p>
From time-to-time we will also take photographs of the orchestra during rehearsals and during concerts specifically for the purpose of ongoing publicising of our future concerts. When such photographs are used in any printed or online publicity activity they will never contain names of individual members.
</p>

<h2>4. Who has access to your personal data?</h2>

<p>
All members of the committee, who have been elected by the orchestra to manage the orchestra and to organise our concerts, will have access to this personal data. Also members of the orchestra who are not members of the committee but who are undertaking specific tasks on behalf of the committee and have a need to access that personal data (e.g. section leaders who need to contact members of their section) will be given appropriate access to that data.
</p>

<h2>5. Do we share your personal data with anyone else?</h2>

<p>
We will never share the personal data of our members with a third party organisation for that third party to use. We do however make use of Cloud Data Storage and Email Providers (e.g. Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook and other reputable e-mail service providers) in order to store and process that data i.e. to contact our members electronically. We will take appropriate measures to protect the personal data of Wolsey Orchestra members stored in the Cloud. Very occasionally we may need to share your data inside or outside the orchestra or to request further personal data e.g. your home address for the legitimate purposes of running the orchestra. On such occasions we will always request active consent.
</p>

<h2>6. How can you control your personal data held by us?</h2>

<p>
At any time you can ask to view and update any of your personal data held by the Wolsey Orchestra by contacting the Chairman at <a href="mailto:wolseyorchestra@outlook.com">wolseyorchestra@outlook.com</a>, or by speaking to any member of the committee. If you decide to leave the orchestra and no longer wish to be contacted by the orchestra we will respect that decision and mark your personal data record accordingly.
</p>

<p>
As a registered charity, we can not simply delete all your personal data as we are obliged to keep certain details for financial purposes (e.g. Gift Aid Declarations) and to keep all historical records of all committee meetings and general meetings which may include the names of, and refer to, individual members.
